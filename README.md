*Prepares and presents them tasty links just the way you like*

Some websites have assets (web pages, image, video, sound, or text files)
which are named named using numeric sequences and/or are stored in directory structures which are named that way.  

When navigating to those resources within those websites' pages is onerous, you
might wish that you could easily generate an HTML page of your own that includes
links to a subset of those resources that  you've defined.

That's where `Links Rustler` comes in.

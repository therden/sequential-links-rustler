# Sequential Links Rustler

*Prepares and presents them tasty links just the way you like*

Some websites have pages which contain links to assets (other web pages, or
image, video, sound, or text files) that are named and/or stored in directories
that are named using numeric sequences.

When navigating to those resources through those websites' pages feels like a
slog, you might find yourself wishing you could generate your own HTML page with
links to a selected subset of those resources.

That's where `Sequential Links Rustler` comes in.

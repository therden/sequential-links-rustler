# Sequential Links Rustler

*Prepares and presents them tasty links just the way you like*

Website pages sometimes contain links -- other web pages, or image, video,
sound, or text files -- for which the files and/or directories are named using
numeric sequences.

When the design or organization of those pages makes accessing those resources a
chore, you might want to generate your own HTML page with links to a selected subset of those resources.

That's where `Sequential Links Rustler` comes in.

# Sequential Links Rustler

<img width="45%" align="right" src="https://github.com/therden/links-rustler/blob/main/combined.png">

*Prepares and presents them tasty links just the way you like*

Website pages sometimes contain links -- other web pages, or image, video,
sound, or text files -- for which the files and/or directories are named using
numeric sequences.

When the design or organization of those pages makes accessing those resources a
chore, you might want to generate your own HTML page with links to a selected
subset of those resources.

That's where __Sequential Links Rustler__ comes in.


Getting Started
---------------
1.  Clone this repository, or download and extract [this zip file](https://github.com/therden/sequential-links-rustler/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2.  Change to the directory containing these files
3.  Run `python slr.py` or `python3 slr.py`
4.  In the resulting GUI dialog
    - fill in the URL mask -- see examples below and [here](https://therden.github.io/sequential-links-rustler),
    <!-- - set any desired options,-->
    - click _Rustle Up Some Links_, and then
    - sit back and wait (not long!) for your new web page to load.

Basic Usage
-----------
__Sequential Links Rustler__ accepts a __"URL mask"__ and generates an HTML page with links to the set of resources that were specified, opening the resulting file in a new browser tab.

A __URL mask__ is just like a standard URL, except that a __"sequence definition"__ has been substituted in place of a numeric value.

A minimal __sequence definition__ consists of a *Start* integer and a *Stop* integer, separated by a hyphen and surrounded by curly brackets.  

The links generated by __Sequential Links Rustler__ consist of the URL mask, with the next sequential value replacing the sequence definition in each. For example, the URL mask

`https://therden.github.io/sequential-links-rustler/images/sausage{0-20}.jpeg`

includes the sequence definition `{0-20}`, and from it __Sequential Links Rustler__ will produce and load an HTML page that looks like

Other Features
---------------
- #### declining sequences

    Within the sequence definition, make *Start* the larger and *Stop* the smaller value.

    For example:  changing the sequence definition in the above example to `{20-0}` will generate the same page, but the images will display in reverse order.

- #### spacing between generated values

    Between the *Stop* value and the closing curly bracket, insert a semi-colon and an integer representing the distance between consecutive values.

    | sequence definition | set of values produced |
    | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
    | {0-9;2}          | 0, 2, 4, 6, 8          |
    | {0-9;3}          | 0, 3, 6, 9             |
    | {9-0;2}          | 9, 7, 5, 3, 1          |
    | {9-0;3}          | 9, 6, 3, 0             |


- #### zero padding

    When a website's numeric values include leading zeros, just include those in your sequence definition.  Examples:

    | sequence_definition | produces sequence       |
    | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
    | {01-20;5}        | 01, 06, 11, 16          |
    | {020-001; 4}     | 020, 016, 012, 008, 004 |

- #### multiple sequence definitions within a single URL mask

  For example: given the (partial), 3-level URL_mask `foo{1-2}/bar{11-12}/pic{0-2}.jpg`, __Sequential Links Rustler__
  will produce the following (partial) link sequence

  foo1/bar11/pic0.jpeg<br>
  foo1/bar11/pic1.jpeg<br>
  foo1/bar11/pic2.jpeg<br>
  foo1/bar12/pic0.jpeg<br>
  foo1/bar12/pic1.jpeg<br>
  foo1/bar12/pic2.jpeg<br>
  foo2/bar11/pic0.jpeg<br>
  foo2/bar11/pic1.jpeg<br>
  foo2/bar11/pic2.jpeg<br>
  foo2/bar12/pic0.jpeg<br>
  foo2/bar12/pic1.jpeg<br>
  foo2/bar12/pic2.jpeg<br>
